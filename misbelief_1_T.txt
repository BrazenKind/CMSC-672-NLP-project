Do you think 800,000 Americans died of the common cold since covid started? Common cold much less deadly than the flu, which is .1% deadly. Covid is at least 1%, so ten times more deadly than that. Antivacxers are dumb shits.
Covid is much more deadly and infectious than even the most vicious flu strains. Cancer is not deadly for the majority of people who get it, does that mean we should stop paying attention to it?
Being jabbed makes you less likely to catch it and, usually, your case less seriousPer the CDC, during the 2018-19 flu season, there were 28 thousand flu-related deaths.  So far for the U.S., 800 thousand people have died from Covid.
Claiming that Covid is less deadly than flu is a damned stupid thing to lie about. 
It depends on  context but flu is false equivalence because it is far less deadly than COVID, and far less likely to put you in the hospital.
Flu is about 10x less deadly and significantly less infectious than Covid-19. Basic epidemiology/virology/immunology.
Omicron looks like it will have the highest infectious rate of any disease we know of. Basic science stuff.
Agree except the part about being less dangerous than the flu. Of COVID cases, 7% are hospitalized and 1.5% die. Of flu the numbers are 1.3% hosp and 0.1% deaths (COVID is 15x more deadly) if my calcs are correct.
It's crazy how people choose to believe a lie they heard from a friend of a friend of a friend of a friend who read something from a disgruntled ape who just wants control. 
The flu is far less dangerous and deadly than Covid. 99% survival over millions of people is 10,000s of deaths. The flu is more than 10 times less deadly than Covid. Also, I’ll trust health experts across the world and hundreds of peer reviewed studies over what you read on a box.
The jabs do work. Especially after the booster. Flu is less deadly and less contagious than Covid, and doesn’t ever threaten to overwhelm healthcare services in the same way that Covid can, even with vaccines. Oh, and we’re not locked down.
The flu is multitudes less deadly than COVID and this is a bad faith comparison. 
Meanwhile we mandate plenty of vaccines for schools, colleges, workplaces. It's not new at all, it didn't become a political issue until COVID because Republicans viewed it as some weird dem plot@Unvaxxed4Life @Observer254 @teddyluttenburg @ClayTravis The flu is orders of magnitude less deadly and less contagious than Covid. 
No one’s arguing for more lockdowns, we’re merely pointing out that EVEN WITH LOCKDOWNS 100s of thousands people died from Covid. If there’d been no lockdowns, masks, vaccines, millions would’ve died.@savie64 @SkyNews In reality flu is much less deadly than covid.@NONONOEU @ArturM94 @MartynWilliams2 @AndrewShuk2112 Covid is much more deadly and infectious than even the most vicious flu strains.

@ReubenR80027912 @B31918 @MerlinLynn75 @CentristMadness @ChristinaPushaw I'm sorry do you have a medical degree? If it's less deadly than the flu why were there more COVID deaths in kids last year than flu deaths?We never did anything to protect kids from the flu? The flu shot is mandated for all preschools in NY. And, we actually have one for kids!
@jbplus4 @SusanStJames3_ It depends on  context but flu is false equivalence because it is far less deadly than COVID, and far less likely to put you in the hospital.How did you end up so selfish that you don’t care if you infect someone with a disease ? Bad parents, I suppose.

@DodgertheR @Guildford @rohan_connolly The flu is much less deadly than COVID and is exactly what COVID will end up like if everybody follows medical science and gets the very safe vaccines.

Mask up ppl!It's not rocket science.The flu of 1918 was brought under control by masks &amp; social distancing.Fines of up to $5 were given to those unmasked in public.Police didn't take kindly to catching you a 2nd time.Covid is worse than a flu!It has no season.
@Rachael_Swindon @Keir_Starmer @BorisJohnson Over 32,000 people died January 2021 of Covid-19 peaking 19th January when 1,526 died the averaging was 1,056 a day, so adding that to the previous month December 2020 that's 48,000 deaths and yet some people still think Covid-19 is no worse than the Flu
@saletan @EricTopol I think omicron covid for the unvaxxed with no prior covid is much worse than flu is for those who haven't gotten a flu shot. So while the result you speak of (not a ton of damage) might happen, it requires a lot of people to get vaxxed and boosted and/or get covid.
@daniel_eth My intuition was that yes/no would be way more popular, since Covid is worse than the flu and the vaccines are much better (and probably won't need to be refreshed after a few year). A vaccine mandate to get a shot every year for the rest of your life is quite a lot heavier!
@Rosie4213 @liberforever1 @JakksonT getting a mild case of covid, a disease that's killed many times more people than any flu in history provides zero justification to call it no worse than flu. Death rate is much higher. There were an approx average of 400,000 deaths per yr in the US due to covid &amp; 40,000 for flu.
@NathanMackBrown I'm sorry you're suffering. You're one person. Long COVID affects less than 2% of people. It is like any post-viral illness, except a bit worse because COVID is worse &amp; b/c only 50M get the flu in a year and there's prior immunity vs COVID which 150M have gotten with no immunity.
@AConcernedBeing @jennyLbtn @ClareCraigPath The average annual UK flu deaths is around 14,000. The covid deaths are ten times this! The worst flu deaths was around 34,000. The covid deaths are four times this! (And without lockdowns etc it would have been higher.)So don't pretend it is no worse than flu.
